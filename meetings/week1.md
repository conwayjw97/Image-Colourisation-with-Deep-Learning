### Francesco Tonolini

* First task is to build a Deterministic Convolutional Neural Network
* Ideally should be working by week 4
* Deterministic, so no analysis like Bayesian inference and should always give the same output for a given input
* Convert the images into YUV format to pass them to the CNN
* Choose your own technology to work with
