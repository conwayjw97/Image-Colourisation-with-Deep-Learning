## Week 18 - 21 Feb 2020 - Roderick Murray-Smith 

### Progress
* Working CVAE now implemented
* Begun writing analysis section of report
* Made a Colab page to collect metrics about datasets

### Minutes
* Look into a dataset with clear visual priors which aid colourisation (e.g. football players with club tags on their outfits to suggest their colour)
* Look into TSNE for dataset analytics
* Look into UMap for dataset analytics, potentially enhancing the graph on your report with a heat map overlaying it to indicate what images were colourised better
