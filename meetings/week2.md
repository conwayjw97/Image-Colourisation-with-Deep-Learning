## Week 2 - 4 Oct 2019 - Roderick Murray-Smith

### Preparation
* Is it necessary to meet every week?
* Are there any other readings/tasks I should do before starting development?
* Do you need the summer progress report?

### Minutes
* Good sites for searching for academic papers: Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explorer
* Investigate implementing Forward Planning into your project work
* Send a weekly email to supervisors detailing what I've achieved and will work on
* Before each meeting write down what progress I've made since the last meeting
