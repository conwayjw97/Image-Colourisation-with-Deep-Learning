### Minutes

* Make sure abstract summarises instead of motivates
* Define colourisation in the intro, why it's difficult and why it's useful
* Use , instead of ' to separate numbers
* Provide some empirical evidence of why you'd use Machine Learning
* Make sure to add figure num and captions for every image
* Use /leftbracket commands to tidy up brackets within equations
* Remove abbreviations (wasn't -> was not)
* Add a number and captions for function figures
* Don't use the term trial & error ("repeated simulation over a range of values" sounds better)
* Make sure to have captions for model summary figures
* Check citation style to see if you can remove round brackets
* Expand on feature-based colourisation in both the dataset and evaluation sections (talk about how you made it, why it's challenging, why it was needed)
* Add citations for Imagenet
* Delete "N.B." in the evaluation images
* Add more detail in the captions for the evaluation images
* Citations in the bibliography need to include the venue and be in capitals
