* To track overfitting, plot the loss for both training and testing images as the CNN is being trained
* Train with as many images as possible (all 50'000 for cifar10)
* Investigate making the kernel equal to the smallest convolutional shape (4, 4), to see if it helps find global correlations
* When the CNN works will for cifar10 images, try using bigger resolution images
