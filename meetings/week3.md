## Week 3 - 11 Oct 2019 - Francesco Tonolini

### Preparation
* Version control necessary for CNN?
* Version control necessary for timelog?
* How does batch size effect training outcome?
* What do the output filters do?
* How does Kernel size effect training outcome?

### Minutes
* To track overfitting, plot the loss for both training and testing images as the CNN is being trained
* Train with as many images as possible (all 50'000 for cifar10)
* Investigate making the kernel equal to the smallest convolutional shape (4, 4), to see if it helps find global correlations
* When the CNN works will for cifar10 images, try using bigger resolution images
