## Week 5.2 - 25 Oct 2019 - Roderick Murray-Smith & Francesco Tonnolini

### Preparation
* Plotted the loss for both training and testing images 
* Tried using a higher resolution dataset with images that conform to a more specific category (flowers)
* Noticed considerable validation improvement with flower dataset
* Noticed positive impact of increasing number of convolutional filters
* Tried a dataset with images with similar charactersitics (human faces)
* Noticed how this was less susceptible to overfitting and resulted in better testing validation
* Began collecting outputs for different CNN models to notice the effect that kernel size and number of layers has on output
* Couldn't use Colab to train large enough datasets (tf_flowers takes max 800)
* Investigated getting the notebook to run on unvirsity GPU cluster
