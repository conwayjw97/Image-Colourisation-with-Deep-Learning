## Week 5 - 22 Oct 2019 - Francesco Tonnolini

### Preparation
* Read chapters 10, 11, and 13 of Hands-On Machine Learning (Intro to NN, Training DNNs, CNNs)
* Investigated how the CNN functions
* Realized issues validating cifar10 dataset
* Plotted the loss for both training and testing images 
* Tried using a higher resolution dataset with images that conform to a more specific category (flowers)
* Noticed considerable validation improvement with flower dataset
* Noticed positive impact of increasing number of convolutional filters
* Investigated getting the notebook to run on local GPU
* Couldn't use Colab to train large enough datasets (tf_flowers takes max 800)
* Set up Github repository
