# Deep Learning Solutions for Image Colourisation

This repository contains the code and data involved in the development of my final year dissertation project.

## Project

Colourisation is a difficult and ambiguous problem, and a reliable solution for it needs to account for a significant amount of information. This project investigated the use of Deep Learning to solve the problem, which was chosen for its ability to generate solutions based on the analysis of large quantities of relevant data. In order to understand which Deep Learning methods were most capable of colourisation, we implemented three systems that seemed like the best candidates: A Convolutional Neural Network, a Generative Adversarial Network, and a Variational Autoencoder. We evaluated each one with the same colourisation tasks, and used the information we gathered to determine which was the most viable solution.
