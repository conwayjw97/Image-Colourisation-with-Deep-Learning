# Deep Learning Solutions for Image Colourisation

![Colourisations](https://github.com/conwayjw97/Image-Colourisation-with-Deep-Learning/blob/master/dissertation/images/RepoPreview.png)

### Background

This project investigated the use of Deep Learning to solve the problem of image colourisation. In order to understand which Deep Learning methods were most capable of colourisation, we implemented three systems that seemed like the best candidates: 
* A Convolutional Neural Network
* A Generative Adversarial Network
* A Variational Autoencoder
We evaluated each one with the same colourisation tasks, and used the information we gathered to determine which was the most viable solution.
