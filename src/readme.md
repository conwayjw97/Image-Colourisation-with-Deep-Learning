# Readme

Here are the notebooks containing the code to train and test each of the models that were implemented for this project. 

Each notebook corresponds to:

* CNN.ipynb: Convolutional Neural Network 

* CNN.ipynb: Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

* CVAE.ipynb: Convolutional Variational Autoencoder 

Please see manual.md for more specific instructions on how to use these notebooks, including how to load pre-trained models into them, and how to train and test your own models.
