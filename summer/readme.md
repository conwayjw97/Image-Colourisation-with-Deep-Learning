* 2247492
* Roderick Murray-Smith

Use this file to keep a report stating what you completed over the summer. The following is an *template* that you can use as a basis. 

## Research completed
Read the start of "100 page ML book".
Read chapter 1 and 4 of "Introduction to inverse problems in imaging".
Studied an inverse problem exercise given by Francesco.
Read the following articles:

## Ideas developed
Should learn how to use Tensorflow effectively as it is a well documented library for developing deep learning projects.
Colab would be an ideal development platform for sharing and running ML code on.
Should learn about convolutional and generative adversarial neural networks as they have been used previously in image colourization projects such as the ones in the articles above.

## Concerns or risks identified
Difficulty in understanding the matrix algebra which will be necessary for development.
Difficulty in using Tensorflow.
